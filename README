This is the auto admin generator on Codeigniter.

I'm still working hard on it.

if you hava any suggestion:
    mail it to me <xobkkmp3 AT gmail DOT com>
    OR
    create an issue

Thanks!

usage:

1. create your model in application/models/ with name xxxx_model.php
    (e.g. news_model, user_detail_model)

2. declared the field in model, you can see an example in application/models/news_model.php

3. add the model to model_list in the config: admin_generator.php

4. add the admin_generator's method to any controller you want, you can see the example in the application/controllers/welcome.php
